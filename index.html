                        <div class="about_text">
                            <p>This essay explores how self-reflection has transformed my life by fostering personal
                                growth, reducing anxiety, and enhancing collaboration. In the past, I relied on academic
                                success for validation, but the transition from junior high to senior high school
                                challenged this mindset as I struggled with my grades. This led me to question my
                                self-worth and engage in deeper introspection. Through this process, I realized that my
                                value extends beyond academics and includes my contributions to others and the
                                community. By participating in volunteer work, team activities, and social engagement, I
                                discovered a more well-rounded sense of identity. </p>
                            <p> In university, I came to understand that everyone has their own unique goals and
                                challenges, and I stopped comparing myself to others. Instead, I focused on
                                collaboration and personal growth. In my field of computer science, I recognized the
                                importance of teamwork and diverse perspectives for achieving success. Through
                                self-reflection, I shifted my mindset to view challenges as opportunities for learning,
                                which helped me reduce the anxiety caused by constant comparisons and high expectations.
                                Self-reflection has allowed me to build stronger relationships, embrace collaboration,
                                and approach life with a more positive outlook.</p>

                            <p><span class="display-4">Anxiety</span> is a common issue that affects many university
                                students, often
                                impacting their
                                academic performance and social interactions. This research aims to understand how
                                studying in Sino-foreign universities, which provide a more open academic
                                environment—such as encouraging classroom discussions involving diverse perspectives,
                                fostering higher student participation, and promoting critical thinking—compared with
                                traditional Chinese schools and English-based instruction, influences anxiety levels in
                                Chinese students. Students in this environment face not only academic challenges but
                                also cultural expectations that come with studying in an international environment. They
                                need to adapt to different teaching methods, classroom norms, and expectations regarding
                                their participation, which may differ significantly from those they are accustomed to in
                                traditional Chinese educational settings. Like Sino-foreign universities encourage
                                students to actively participate in class discussions, which contrasts significantly
                                with the more traditional, lecture-focused environment of Chinese schools. </p>
                            <p>Specifically, the study explores how language barriers, academic pressure, and social
                                interactions with diverse peers contribute to anxiety in this unique educational
                                setting. By combining data from primary sources and insights from secondary literature,
                                this study seeks to identify key challenges and suggest effective ways to support
                                students.</p>

                        <p>To collect primary data, a survey was conducted among 100 Chinese students in NYU Shanghai.
                            The survey focused on their experiences with language barriers, academic
                            expectations, and social anxiety when interacting with peers from diverse backgrounds. The

                            environment. This anxiety was further intensified by the fear of making mistakes or being
                            judged by others. Many students were not accustomed to actively participating in class
                            discussions in their previous Chinese education, which made it difficult for them to adapt

                                <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"> Sawir et al. (2008) emphasized the role
                                    of social support networks in reducing anxiety among international students,
                                    including Chinese students in foreign academic settings. The study found that
                                    students who developed strong peer networks could better manage academic and social
                                    pressures, which improved their well-being and academic outcomes. However, the study
                                    also highlighted that language barriers often contribute to interpersonal anxiety,
                                    making it challenging for students to build these supportive networks. This aligns
                                    with the primary research findings, where students expressed the need to form
                                    connections but faced difficulties due to both language and cultural barriers. Sawir
                                    et al's research suggests that fostering peer support and encouraging social
                                    activities may alleviate some of the anxiety and interpersonal challenges associated
                                    with language difficulties.</p>

                                <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Tang T. Heng explores how Chinese
                                    students in U.S. institutions experience anxiety as they adapt to a Western academic
                                    environment that emphasizes open discussion and critical debate(2018). Heng’s study
                                    highlights that many Chinese students struggle with language barriers and cultural
                                    differences, which can intensify their anxiety in classroom settings that require
                                    frequent participation. This anxiety often stems from stereotypes that portray them
                                    as passive or uncritical learners. Despite these challenges, Heng finds that, over
                                    time, Chinese students develop alternative ways to demonstrate their understanding
                                    and adapt to the classroom dynamics. Rather than viewing their behavior as a
                                    deficiency, Heng argues that it reflects a different approach to learning,
                                    suggesting that with the right support, students can mitigate anxiety and succeed in
                                    interactive academic settings.</p>

                        <p>The integration of primary data and secondary literature reveals a complex relationship
                            between language barriers, academic pressure, and anxiety levels among Chinese students in
                            Sino-foreign universities. The survey data indicate that the transition to an English-based
                            environment, along with high academic expectations and interactions with diverse peers, can
                            significantly increase anxiety. The findings from secondary sources provide a broader

                                In traditional Chinese culture, seeking help can sometimes be perceived as a sign of
                                weakness, which may prevent students from utilizing available resources.
                                Additionally, students may struggle with time management, finding it difficult to
                                make time for these activities due to their already demanding academic workload.
                                Addressing these cultural and logistical barriers through education, awareness
                                campaigns, and flexible program options could encourage more students to seek help
                                when needed. Universities could promote the tangible benefits of support programs
                                more effectively and integrate them more seamlessly into student life. Additionally,
                                students themselves should be made more aware of how these resources can
                                significantly aid their adjustment and overall well-being. By understanding these
                                obstacles, universities can better tailor their support initiatives to meet the
                                needs of their students. </p>

                                Moreover, cultural differences between the traditional Chinese education system and the
                                educational practices in Sino-foreign universities contribute to the challenges faced by
                                students. In the Chinese educational environment, there is a strong emphasis on
                                respecting authority and maintaining silence during lectures, which can lead to reduced
                                classroom participation. This contrasts sharply with the open, discussion-based approach
                                encouraged in Sino-foreign universities, where active participation is often expected
                                and assessed. The cultural expectation to remain quiet and respect the teacher's
                                authority may make it difficult for Chinese students to adapt to a learning environment
                                that values questioning, discussion, and critical thinking. As a result, students may
                                experience increased anxiety when required to engage in class discussions or express
                                their views openly. </p>

                                Interpersonal relationships also play a crucial role in influencing anxiety levels among
                                Chinese students in Sino-foreign universities. As highlighted in the primary research, a
                                significant proportion of students experience anxiety due to difficulties in socializing
                                with peers from different cultural backgrounds. The challenge of establishing
                                friendships with foreign peers is often compounded by language barriers and cultural
                                differences, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. This interpersonal anxiety
                                can further exacerbate academic stress, as students may lack a supportive social network
                                to rely on during challenging times. The findings from Sawir et al. (2008) suggest that
                                fostering peer support networks is essential in helping students navigate these social
                                challenges. Universities can play a pivotal role in facilitating social integration by
                                organizing activities that encourage intercultural interactions, thus helping students
                                form meaningful connections and reducing their overall anxiety levels. </p>

                                barriers, academic pressure, and social interactions with diverse peers all contribute
                                to
                                increased anxiety. By combining primary survey data with existing literature, this
                                research
                                highlights the need for targeted support and intervention. Universities must take steps
                                to
                                ensure that mental health resources are accessible, that students receive support in
                                adapting to an English-based environment, and that the learning environment is
                                inclusive.
                                Addressing these challenges holistically will help students overcome barriers, build
                                resilience, and succeed both academically and socially in a multicultural educational
                                setting. </p>
